  "summary": "I am a recent graduate from York University's Lassonde School of Engineering with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Toronto. During my time at York, I worked in the school's IT department, where I was the source of support for several business applications. I also spent 16 months working as an intern at Hydro One Telecom where I built scripts in Python and Bash to automate various tasks. Through these various experiences, I was able to demonstrate my problem-solving and communication skills. My interest in pursuing a career in software started when I took an 'Introduction to Programming' course during my first undergrad. Programming drew me in due to its ability to create and build things in a very accessible manner. I was able to see the results of my work in just a couple of lines of code. Currently, I am an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I have improved my proficiency in various tools and technologies such as Java, Linux, and Docker. I am looking forward to bring my skills and knowledge and contribute to your team.\n"
