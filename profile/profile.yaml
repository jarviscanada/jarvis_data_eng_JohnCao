summary: >
  I am a recent graduate from York University's Lassonde School of Engineering with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Toronto.
  During my time at York, I worked in the school's IT department, where I was the source of support for several business applications.
  I also spent 16 months working as an intern at Hydro One Telecom where I built scripts in Python and Bash to automate various tasks.
  Through these various experiences, I was able to demonstrate my problem-solving and communication skills.
  My interest in pursuing a career in software started when I took an 'Introduction to Programming' course during my first undergrad. Programming drew me in due to its ability to create and build things in a very accessible manner. I was able to see the results of my work in just a couple of lines of code.
  Currently, I am an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, where I have improved my proficiency in various tools and technologies such as Java, Linux, and Docker.
  I am looking forward to bring my skills and knowledge and contribute to your team.

    description: Implemented a Linux cluster monitoring solution using bash shell scripts to collect hardware specifications of each server running on CentOS and their resource usage. Data is collected and stored in an RDBMS (Postgresql) provisioned using Docker. The resource usage data is collected periodically using crontab. SQL is used to query the data for later data analysis.

    description:
      - "JDBC App: Programmed an application utilizing the JDBC API to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. App functionality was implemented using the DAO design pattern."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java application that simulates the grep command in Linux. The application takes in a text pattern as user input and searches for it recursively in a given directory. The app is written in Java and uses the Stream API for memory efficiency. Maven was used to build and package the project which is available on DockerHub."
